### About Me

In my most recent role, I worked in the financial sector, collaborating with a team of developers to create innovative solutions that facilitated currency (USD) transactions in a brokerage house in Mexico (Vifaru). These solutions enabled individual investors to purchase fractional shares on the NYSE through a US-based broker (Drivewealth), connecting both brokers (Mexico-USA) with the assistance of an investment advisor (Flink). I am driven by the objective of consistently applying and expanding my skills to develop robust and effective technical solutions in my upcoming role.
